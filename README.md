<h3>Project description:</h3>
The dashboard below presents a visualization of data regarding the incidence of covid-19. The free version of AWS Quicksight does not support sharing an interactive report.
Dashboard shows the number of total cases, number of total deaths and the percentage of deaths per case worldwide.A filter has been added to select the continents we are interested in. 
Key Performance Indicator (KPI) are used to present a comparison of latest trend in cases and deaths over consecutive weeks. Using metrics, we can choose which information we want to display and the date range. 
Horizontal bar chart shows the metric to display by continent and countries. The average incidence of disease by date is presented in the clustered bar combo chart. Thanks to the points on map, we can see the sum of all recorded Covid-19 cases. 
After clicking on the selected country, we can go to the website to see travel restrictions. We can also choose to see the vaccination trend, which will take us to the next, more detailed report. 
Word cloud shows the selected country, KPI compares the number of people fully vaccinated to the population of the selected country. Clustered bar combo chart compares the number of fully vaccinated population to the incidence of new cases by date.
